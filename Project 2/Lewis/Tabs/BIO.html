            Lewis took the time to get to know Brian and me. He listened to our story, how we met, our relationship, and what we are both passionate about. Based on those intimate conversations, Lewis worked with us to select meaningful songs for our wedding. We wanted a very God-centered wedding, and as we discussed the music, we were able to put together a beautiful set list. Lewis also took the time to visit the Chapel, make sure the piano was tuned properly and rehearse with our vocalist. Lewis played a significant role in making our wedding a memorable one for everyone.
